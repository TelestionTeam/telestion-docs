        <note>Nodes need to know which node holds the required information as requests are directed
            at one node only. If this knowledge is unavailable, <term>Request-For-Broadcast</term>
            might be the better choice.</note>
        <p>Request-based communication requires continuous, recurring polls for information to keep
            information up-to-date. </p>
        <p>Each transaction in communication is a self-contained set of a Request and a Response (or
            the lack therof). This makes it easy to implement role-based access rights and other
            security measures.</p>
        <p><keyword>HTTP</keyword> is a common protocol implementing this concept, making it
            especially easy to use in communication <term>Backend</term>â†’Web-based
